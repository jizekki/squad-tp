Our work on the transformers TP.

# Possible improvements

As the training takes some times, we couldn't try to change all the hyper-parameters. However, we believe that the score could improve if we try these improvements:

- Increase the number of epochs (to 3 and then to 4).
- Change the weight decay to different values (maybe to its default value in fastai that is 0.01 ?)
- Decreasing the learning rate could also help.
